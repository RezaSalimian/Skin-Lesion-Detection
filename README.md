These are python files to identify cancerous skin lesions called malignant from benign.

* To use these codes you need to add a folder named "Data" including "train" and "test" folders, each including malignant and benign folders containing the labeled images datasets.

* Then you just must run "train-cnn" and "train-conventional" python codes and you will get the results as csv, Jpeg.
